============================================

This project presents a comprehensive quantitative analysis of historical marketing and sales data to **forecast revenue** and **evaluate the causal impact of various marketing channels and competitor activity**. Utilizing a **multi-methodological approach**, the study progresses from traditional statistical modeling to advanced Bayesian techniques.

The core objectives include:

* **Establishing a robust baseline for revenue prediction** using classical Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression, providing interpretable insights into key revenue drivers.
* **Exploring time-series methodologies** to capture inherent temporal dependencies and seasonal patterns in revenue data, enhancing forecasting accuracy.
* **Implementing Bayesian statistical models** to provide a probabilistic framework for parameter estimation and explicit **quantification of uncertainty** in forecasts.
* **Demonstrating Bayesian belief updating**, illustrating how prior domain knowledge can be formally integrated with empirical data to refine parameter estimates and test hypotheses about marketing effectiveness.
